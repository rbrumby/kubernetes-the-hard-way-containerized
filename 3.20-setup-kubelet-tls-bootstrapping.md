# TLS bootstrapping the kubelet with the API server
At this point, the kubelet has started etcd & the API server. It is currently repeastedly trying to use the bootstrap kubeconfig (containing the bootstrap token) to authenticate. But the API Server doesn't know anything about that bootstrap token yet. We will fix that now.

## Create the bootstrap secret in the kube-system namespace
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: bootstrap-token-${BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN_ID}
  namespace: kube-system
type: bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token
stringData:
  expiration: 2021-11-11T11:11:11Z
  description: "Default bootstrap token for the cluster."
  token-id: ${BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN_ID}
  token-secret: ${BOOTSTRAP_SECRET}
  usage-bootstrap-authentication: "true"
  usage-bootstrap-signing: "true"
  auth-extra-groups: system:bootstrappers:worker
EOF
```
### What just happened?
- We created a special kind of secret in etcd (via the API server) for bootstrapping with a token ID & secret matching what we put in our kubelets bootstrap kubeconfig file (bootstrap-kubelet.conf).

## Create cluster-role-bindings
Per [this document](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/), give permissions to bootstrapping nodes
When the kubelet authenticates with the bootstrap token, it will automatically be made a member of the system:boostrappers group.
The below gives that group the permissions to create a certificate signing request so that the kubelet can obtain a certificate from the API server.
This will only need to be done once on the first master in the cluster.
The final role & binding in this list is to allow the kube-apiserver to access the kubelet API to retrieve logs, execute pod commands, etc.
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -

  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```
### What just happened?
- We gave the "system:bootstrappers" group the necessary permissions (and therefore our kubelet which is authenticating with a bootstrap token) to request a certificate from the API Server as well as other permissions included in the "system:node-bootstrapper" role.
- The kubelet should now successfully authenticate with the API server & should submit a certificate signing request which, once we set up the controller manager will be issued & allow the kubelet to manage its own certificates. We should be able to see that CSR by:
```
kubectl get csr
```
- If the CSR isn't there, use "journalctl -u kubelet" as before to see what is happening in the kubelet. If you see errors about user "system:anonymous" not having permissions to create a certificate signing request, it may be that you have restarted the kubelet multiple times since we created the bootstrap kubeconfig & the kubelet may have generated the kubelet.conf (in the /etc/kubernetes directory) and is trying to use that to authenticate. If that is the case, delete the kubelet.conf file & restart the kubelet. If you still have problems, make sure the bootstrap token ID & secret are consistently set in the secret above & in the bootstrap-kubelet.conf file and that they conform to the regular expression in the bootstrap setup section.
