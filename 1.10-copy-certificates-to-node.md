# Copy common files to the node
Whilst deploying our node, we will need some of the common artefacts we created in section 0.

## Copy & edit env.sh
In section 0, we created an env.sh file in the /etc/kubernetes directory. Wew ill reuse that file on every node but we must remember to modify the CURRENT_NODE environment variable to match each node.

## If this is a control plane node
If we are deploying a control plane node, we need everything we created within the /etc/kubernetes/pki directory in section 0 copied to the same location on the current node.

## If this is a worker node
If we are deploying a worker node, we only need the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt file (in addition to our env.sh).
