# Creating our admin user kubeconfig (~/.kube/config)
This file will be used by us later (using kubectl from the command line) to connect to the cluster.
We're setting embed-certs to true to make the file more portable (if you have kubectl on your local machine, you can administer the cluster from there)
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

sudo kubectl config set-cluster k8sc01 \
  --certificate-authority=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt \
  --embed-certs=true \
  --server="https://${MASTER_LB}:6443"

sudo kubectl config set-credentials system-admin \
  --client-certificate=/etc/kubernetes/pki/admin.crt \
  --client-key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/admin.key \
  --embed-certs=true

sudo kubectl config set-context system-admin@k8sc01 \
  --cluster=k8sc01 \
  --user=system-admin

sudo kubectl config use-context system-admin@k8sc01

sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} ~/.kube
```
### What just happened?
- We created a kubeconfig file that the kubectl CLI will use to connect to & authenticate with the API Server.
- We embedded certs to make the file portable so that it can be transferred to our local machine so that we can run kubectl from there.
- We had to use "sudo" as our regular user probably doesn't have permission to read all of the certs (if we are doing this securely!) so we then had to change ownership on the resulting config file created in our home directories ".kube" subdirectory.
