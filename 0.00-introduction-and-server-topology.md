# This guide was designed around building the below
This guide was designed for building the below cluster architecture.
As the guide progressed, I found myself organizing the sections into what hopefully has become something that anyone could fairly easily understand & adapt into any architecture they choose.
So the guide doesn't cover individual node setups (that might change depending on feedback!). If set up correctly, the env.sh script created in section 0 should be enough to allow you to work through the sections relevant for each node in the cluster.

I use keepalived to manage the 2 Virtual IP (VIP) addresses mentioned below. I will try to add details of my keepalived setup soon.
I also have my own domain & use Cloudflare DNS to maintain private subnet host names (because it is free & easier than maintaining my own DNS server).
If you don't have a domain & want to build you cluster using purely IP addresses, that should work by just removing all of the hostname references from the env.sh in part 0.10.

## Master nodes
Primary IP    hostname
192.168.1.51  k8sc01m01
192.168.1.52  k8sc01m02
192.168.1.53  k8sc01m03

### Master node DNS (I use a domain registered with Cloudflare)
k8sc01m.${DOMAIN}    192.168.1.50    This is a VIP (secondary IP) I have assigned to the below master nodes using keepalived.
k8sc01m01.${DOMAIN}  192.168.1.51    The first master node we will configure.
k8sc01m02.${DOMAIN}  192.168.1.52
k8sc01m02.${DOMAIN}  192.168.1.53

## Worker nodes
- Primary IP    hostname
- 192.168.1.61  k8sc01w01
- 192.168.1.62  k8sc01w02

### Worker node DNS (again with Cloudflare)
- k8sc01w    192.168.1.50    This is a VIP (secondary IP) I have assigned to the below worker nodes using keepalived.
- k8sc01w01  192.168.1.61
- k8sc01w02  192.168.1.62

***Before starting deployment, if you are using a VIP you should ensure that the VIP address is assigned to the first node you are deploying to.***
