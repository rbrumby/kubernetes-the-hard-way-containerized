# Set up some environment variables 
(to limit mistakes as we go through the following steps).

There are quite a lot of certificates to create to setp up the cluster. To keep that number manageable (and to make things easier to explain), server certificates which require hostnames / IP addresses in them will be shared across nodes. We will therefore put all node addresses in a single certificate & distribute that certificate across the nodes.

We will create an environment script that we'll use to make sure we use consistent values throughout.
If you are using different IP addresses, host names, etc, change them in the env.sh script below.
```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/kubernetes

cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/env.sh
#Change the following 2 entries to suit your environment & the current node you are installing on (and/or modify the IP address lists below to use different IP addresses)
export DOMAIN=put-your-domain-here-or-remove-domain-refs-from-this-file-if-you-are-only-using-ip-addresses.com
export CURRENT_NODE=k8sc01m01.\${DOMAIN}

export ETCD_MEMBERS="k8sc01m01=https://k8sc01m01.\${DOMAIN}:2380,k8sc01m02=https://k8sc01m02.\${DOMAIN}:2380,k8sc01m03=https://k8sc01m03.\${DOMAIN}:2380"

export MASTER_NODE_ADDRS="192.168.1.51,k8sc01m01.\${DOMAIN},192.168.1.52,k8sc01m02.\${DOMAIN},192.168.1.53,k8sc01m03.\${DOMAIN}"
export MASTER_LB="k8sc01m.\${DOMAIN}"
export MASTER_LB_ADDRS="192.168.1.50,\${MASTER_LB}"

export WORKER_NODE_ADDRS="192.168.1.61,k8sc01w01.\${DOMAIN},192.168.1.62,k8sc01w02.\${DOMAIN}"
export WORKER_LB="k8sc01w.\${DOMAIN}"
export WORKER_LB_ADDRS="192.168.1.60,\${WORKER_LB}"

### What just happened?
- We created a script to set environment variables which we will source throughout the rest of the steps in building the cluster. Feel free to change values to experiment & personalise your deployment.
- SERVICE_CIDR can be set to whatever you prefer to use that doesn't collide with other ranges on your network. Services Kubernetes creates to proxy your pods will be created in this range.
- The Kubernetes API server will have a service created for it using the first address in the service CIDR range.
- Kube-DNS (actually CoreDNS) will have a service created for it using the .10 address in the service CIDR range.
- We also created variables for the bootstrap token ID & secret (explained later) which we will use for bootstrapping the kubelet with the API Server.
