# Create certificates for the control plane components
This is quite lengthy but stick with it. It is by far the most long & boring part of the process!

We'll use [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) because openssl needs a lot of config for signing certificates containing "Subject Alternate Name" entries.
Install cfssl on Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y golang-cfssl
```
...alternatively check the link above or use your distro's package manager.

Following https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/, all cfssl generated files are renamed in the below (from cfssls default ".pem" to ".crt" & ".key").

The following certificates only need to be created once but then need to copied to ALL master nodes.
The /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt file will also need to be copied to the worker nodes.

## Create a directory structure for the certificates
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh
mkdir -p ${CERTDIR}/etcd
```

## Create the etcd Certificate Authority
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/etcd/etcd-ca-csr.json
{
  "CN": "ETCD CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "ETCD",
      "OU": "CA"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert -initca ${CERTDIR}/etcd/etcd-ca-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a certificate authority to sign all certificates relating to etcd access. The etcd server nodes will use this CA certificate to validate the certificates of connecting clients.
- By default users/roles are disabled in etcd (for backward compatibility with older versions which didn't have such functionality) so anyone with a valid certificate can do anything in the database. That's fine because only the API server will access etcd so different users & roles are unnecessary.

## Create the etcd server certificate
This is the cert the etcd server will present to connecting clients.
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/etcd/etcd-csr.json
{
  "CN": "etcd",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "ETCD"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.key \
  -hostname="${MASTER_NODE_ADDRS},${MASTER_LB_ADDRS},localhost,127.0.0.1" \
  ${CERTDIR}/etcd/etcd-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/etcd/server

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/server.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/server.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/server-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/server.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a certificate with the -hostname option so that connecting clients will trust the server no matter which of the addresses they use.

## Create the etcd peer certificate
This is the certificate that etcd peers will use to log into each each-other to set up the cluster.
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.key \
  -hostname="${MASTER_NODE_ADDRS},localhost,127.0.0.1" \
  ${CERTDIR}/etcd/etcd-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/etcd/peer

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/peer.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/peer.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/etcd/peer-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/etcd/peer.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a certificate with the -hostname option so that other etcd nodes will trust the server. This certificate will be used across all of our etcd nodes, hence it contains all of the addresses.

## Create a CA for the rest of our control-plane certificates
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/ca-csr.json
{
  "CN": "Kubernetes CA",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "O": "Kubernetes",
      "OU": "CA"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert -initca ${CERTDIR}/ca-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/ca

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/ca.pem ${CERTDIR}/ca.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/ca-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/ca.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a separate CA from the etcd CA, otherwise anyone with a certificate signed by this CA (eg. your developers, admins, etc) would have full access to etcd. This CA certificate will be used by the control plane components to validate the certificates of connecting clients and by those clients to validate the servers they are connecting to.

## Create the API Servers etcd client certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-csr.json
{
  "CN": "apiserver-etcd-client",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "APISERVER"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/etcd/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-client

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-client.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-client.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-client-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-etcd-client.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a certificate signed by the etcd CA. The API server will use this certificate to authenticate with etcd.

## Create the API Servers kubelet client certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-csr.json
{
  "CN": "system:kube-apiserver",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "system:masters"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-client

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-client.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-client.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-client-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-kubelet-client.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created a certificate for a member of the "system:masters" group so the API Server will have full access to the kubelet.

## Create the API Servers TLS certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

export APISERVER_STD_ADDRS="${APISERVER_SVC_IP},kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local"
export APISERVER_ALL_ADDRS="${MASTER_NODE_ADDRS},${MASTER_LB_ADDRS},${APISERVER_STD_ADDRS},localhost,127.0.0.1"

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-csr.json
{
  "CN": "kube-apiserver",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "APISERVER"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  -hostname="${APISERVER_ALL_ADDRS}" \
  ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/apiserver

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/apiserver-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/apiserver.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created the certificate that the API Server will present to connecting clients.
- The API server can ben accessed externally or internally by the names we defined in our env.sh script.
- It can also be accessed internally by a variety of hostnames as well as by a service which will be created by Kubernetes using the first IP address in the SERVICE_CIDR range.
- The -hostname therefore contains all of the possible names & addresses that clients could connect using - otherwise those clients may not trust the server.

## Create the controller-manager certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager-csr.json
{
  "CN": "system:kube-controller-manager",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  }
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager.pem ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/controller-manager.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created the certificate the controller-manager will use to log into the API Server.
- This certificate identifies the holder as "system:kube-controller-manager" to ensure our controller manager gets the necessary permissions in the cluster.

## Create the scheduler certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/scheduler-csr.json
{
  "CN": "system:kube-scheduler",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  }
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/scheduler-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/scheduler

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/scheduler.pem ${CERTDIR}/scheduler.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/scheduler-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/scheduler.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created the certificate the kube-scheduler will use to log into the API Server.
- This certificate identifies the holder as "system:kube-scheduler" to ensure our scheduler gets the necessary permissions in the cluster.

## Create the service account signing key-pair
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/sa-csr.json
{
  "CN": "sa",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "cert-signer"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/sa-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/sa

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/sa.pem ${CERTDIR}/sa.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/sa-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/sa.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created the key-pair that the controller will use to sign service account tokens.
- Note: kubeadm creates a public/private key-pair rather than a cert but to keep things simple, we'll create the cert (which contains the public key anyway).

## Create the system administrator certificate
```
. /etc/kubernetes/env.sh

cat <<EOF | sudo tee ${CERTDIR}/admin-csr.json
{
  "CN": "Administrator",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "UK",
      "O": "system:masters"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

sudo cfssl gencert \
  -ca=${CERTDIR}/ca.crt \
  -ca-key=${CERTDIR}/ca.key \
  ${CERTDIR}/admin-csr.json | sudo cfssljson -bare ${CERTDIR}/admin

sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/admin.pem ${CERTDIR}/admin.crt
sudo mv ${CERTDIR}/admin-key.pem ${CERTDIR}/admin.key
```
### What just happened?
- We created the certificate we will use as an administrator to set up the cluster.
- This certificate makes the holder a member of the "system:masters" group so that we have full access to build our cluster.

# Configure encryption at rest
While we are dealing with one-off security activities, we will create a configuration that teh API Server will use to encrypt secret data stored in etcd.

## Set up encryption at rest for secrets soterd in etcd
```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/pki/encryption-config.yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - identity: {}
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: $(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64)
EOF

sudo chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/encryption-config.yaml
```
### What just happened?
- We created an encryption config that the API server will use (see below) & make sure it is only readable by root. This will allow the API server to encrypt secret data at rest in etcd. As we are already mounting the /etc/kubernetes/pki directory to the API server container & because that directory ought be pretty well locked down, I've chosen to put the encryption config there too.

## At the end of all of this, you should have the following certificates:
```
/etc/kubernetes/pki
    admin.crt
    admin.key
    apiserver.crt
    apiserver.key
    apiserver-etcd-client.crt
    apiserver-etcd-client.key
    apiserver-kubelet-client.crt
    apiserver-kubelet-client.key
    ca.crt
    ca.key
    controller-manager.crt
    controller-manager.key
    encryption-config.yaml
    sa.crt
    sa.key
    scheduler.crt
    scheduler.key
/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
    ca.crt
    ca.key
    peer.crt
    peer.key
    server.crt
    server.key
```
You will also have a bunch of ".csr" & ".json" files which you can archive (or delete as if necessary you can recreate them using the above).

Note that kubelet will generate its own TLS certificate when it is started so we haven't created those here.
